## Objetives:
### Questions that will drive the analysis
- Which product of all the stores generates the highest profits?
- Which months of 2019 will generate the highest profits and on which dates?
- What is the best time to sell our products?

## Conclutions:
- Despite being the least sold product, the McBook Pro Laptop remains the best selling product every month.
- The best times to sell are at 12:00 and 19:00 on Tuesdays, October and December are the best selling months.
- Sales in California were much higher than in the other states, concentrating marketing efforts here would generate higher profits but it is necessary to analyze the competition and market saturation for a better conclusion.
- It is advisable to focus marketing efforts on the McBook Pro as slightly increasing sales in this product could considerably increase profits.
